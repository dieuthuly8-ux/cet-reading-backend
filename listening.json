What about you?\nM: I've registered for Advanced Marketing and Business Statistics. They're both required for my major.\nW: Those sound challenging. I'm thinking about taking International Trade, but I'm worried it might be too difficult.\nM: Actually, I took that last year. The professor is excellent, and if you stay on top of the readings, it's quite manageable.\nW: That's good to know. Did you form any study groups?\nM: Yes, and I highly recommend it. We met twice a week to discuss the material, and it really helped with understanding complex concepts.\nW: Thanks for the advice! I think I'll sign up for it.\n\nConversation 2\n\nW: Excuse me, Professor Johnson. Do you have a moment to discuss my research project?\nM: Of course, Linda. Come in. How's it coming along?\nW: I've finished the literature review, but I'm having trouble narrowing down my research question.\nM: That's a common challenge. What's your general topic area?\nW: I want to explore the impact of social media on consumer behavior, but it seems too broad.\nM: You're right. Try focusing on a specific platform or demographic. For example, how Instagram influences purchasing decisions among young adults.\nW: That's much more focused! Should I look at a particular product category?\nM: Good idea. Fashion or technology products would give you plenty of data to work with.\nW: Thank you, Professor. This really helps clarify my direction.",

        "transcript": "Passage 1\n\nTime management is a crucial skill for university students. With multiple classes, assignments, and extracurricular activities, it's easy to feel overwhelmed. Successful students often use planning tools such as calendars and to-do lists to organize their schedules. Breaking large projects into smaller, manageable tasks can make them less daunting. Additionally, setting specific goals for each study session helps maintain focus and productivity. It's also important to build in time for rest and relaxation, as burnout can negatively impact academic performance.\n\nPassage 2\n\nThe sharing economy has transformed how people access goods and services. Platforms like ride-sharing and home-sharing have become increasingly popular, offering convenience and cost savings. This economic model allows individuals to monetize their underutilized assets, such as cars or spare rooms. However, the sharing economy also raises questions about regulation, worker rights, and traditional business models. As this sector continues to grow, governments and companies must adapt to balance innovation with consumer protection and fair competition.\n\nPassage 3\n\nArtificial intelligence is revolutionizing various industries, from healthcare to finance. Machine learning algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data to identify patterns and make predictions. In medicine, AI assists in diagnosing diseases and developing personalized treatment plans. In the financial sector, it helps detect fraud and assess credit risk. While AI offers tremendous benefits, it also presents challenges, including ethical concerns about privacy and the potential displacement of human workers. As AI technology advances, society must carefully consider its implications and establish appropriate guidelines.",
